Assignment 2: regression
Goals: introduction to pandas, sklearn, linear and logistic regression, multi-class classification.
Start early, as you will spend time searching for the proper syntax, especially when using pandas

PART 1: basic linear regression
The goal is to predict the profit of a restaurant, based on the number of habitants where the restaurant 
is located. The chain already has several restaurants in different cities. Your goal is to model 
the relationship between the profit and the populations from the cities where they are located.

# You will notice that there are several instances (rows), of 2 features (columns). 
# The values to be predicted are reported in the 2nd column.

# Load the data from the file RegressionData.csv in a pandas dataframe. Make sure all the instances 
# are imported properly. Name the first feature 'X' and the second feature 'y' (these are the labels)

"""
PART 2: logistic regression 
You are a recruiter and your goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to get hired or rejected. 
You have gathered data over the years that you intend to use as a training set. 
Your task is to use logistic regression to build a model that predicts whether an applicant is likely to
be hired or not, based on the results of a first round of interview (which consisted of two technical questions).
The training instances consist of the two exam scores of each applicant, as well as the hiring decision.

# Open the csv file in Excel, notepad++ or any other applications to have a rough overview of the data at hand. 

# Load the data from the file 'LogisticRegressionData.csv' in a pandas dataframe. Make sure all the instances 
# are imported properly. Name the first feature 'Score1', the second feature 'Score2', and the class 'y'
data = pandas.read_csv('LogisticRegressionData.csv', header = None, names=['Score1', 'Score2', 'y']) # 2 points

# Seperate the data features (score1 and Score2) from the class attribute 
X = data[['Score1', 'Score2']].values # 2 points
y = data['y'].values # 2 points

# Plot the data using a scatter plot to visualize the data. 
# Represent the instances with different markers of different colors based on the class labels.
m = ['o', 'x']
c = ['hotpink', '#88c999']

for i in range(len(data)):
    plt.scatter(data['Score1'][i], data['Score2'][i], marker=m[data['y'][i]], color = c[data['y'][i]]) # 2 points
fig.canvas.draw()


# Train a logistic regression classifier to predict the class labels y using the features X
regS = linear_model.LogisticRegression() # 2 points
regS.fit(X,y) # 2 points

# Now, we would like to visualize how well does the trained classifier perform on the training data
# Use the trained classifier on the training data to predict the class labels
y_pred = regS.predict(X) # 2 points

# To visualize the classification error on the training instances, we will plot again the data. However, this time,
# the markers and colors selected will be determined using the predicted class labels
m = ['o', 'x']
c = ['red', 'blue'] #this time in red and blue
fig = plt.figure()

for i in range(len(data)):
    plt.scatter(data['Score1'][i], data['Score2'][i], marker=m[y_pred[i]], color = c[y_pred[i]]) # 2 points

# Notice that some of the training instances are not correctly classified. These are the training errors.


"""
PART 3: Multi-class classification using logistic regression 
Not all classification algorithms can support multi-class classification (classification tasks with more than two classes).
Logistic Regression was designed for binary classification.
One approach to alleviate this shortcoming, is to split the dataset into multiple binary classification datasets 
and fit a binary classification model on each. 
Two different examples of this approach are the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One strategies.
"""

#  One-vs-Rest method (a.k.a. One-vs-All)


# Explain below how the One-vs-Rest method works for multi-class classification # 12 points
"""
One-vs-Rest method is when a model is split data into X number of binary trees to train the model.
Each binary tree consists of one class being the leaf node and the rest of the X-1 class data
being the other leaf node. The binary classifier is trained on each one of the X binary trees
and then makes predictions using the most confident model.

"""

# Explain below how the One-Vs-One method works for multi-class classification # 11 points
"""
One-vs-Rest method is when a model is split data into X number of binary trees to train the model.
Each binary tree is one class as leaf node vs another class as the other leaf node;
X represents all possible unique cominations of one class versus another class.
The binary classifier is trained on each one of the X binary trees; the final 
classification for an instance is determined by the class that receives the most votes from
the one v one strategy
